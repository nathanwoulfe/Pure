# Pure

Pure provides a simple, clean and distraction-free editing interface for content in Umbraco 8.

Intended for use when editing complex content types or writing long-form articles, Pure removes backoffice chrome to leave only the property editors.

`SHIFT+P` switches between regular Umbraco 8 and the Pure editing experience.

Pure works on any Umbraco 8 minor version, but don't let that stop you updating Umbraco to 8.latest...
